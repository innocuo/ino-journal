# InoJournal

InoJournal is a simple app to add quick entries to a sqlite database. It is intended as a work journal/log to keep track of what I'm doing day by day, sort of like a private Twitter.

The app is not intended for public use, so no support is given to compile, run, or use it. Who knows, this might change in the future if the app matures enough.

### Current Todo

* add a preference panel
* add window that lists all entries
* add support for tags
* move database to app support directory
* allow user to set hotkey
* limit character count
