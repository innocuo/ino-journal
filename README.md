A simple app coded in Swift that has two purposes: learn how to code in Swift (for OSX apps) and have a simple app where I can enter quick
text entries to a sqlite database. The idea is to use it as a day/work log, describing what I'm doing (as I'm a coder, I spent most of the
day in front of the pc).

The app is not intended for anybody other than me, so no support is given to compile, run, or use this code. This might change later.
